revamp attempt at server backend for labs 6-10
# Lab-06
**Author:** Daniel Rogahn
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview
This is the first steps to building the City Explorer App in which we write a server
that runs in node.js and deploys to heroku.  It processes requests in the form of GPS
and finds information about the location in the form of objects.

## Getting Started
As per the trello.com cards, found by copying the existing board: City Explorer...
1. Repository set up- making the various files needed for the app and deploying to heroku
2. Locations- write code in the server to handle requests for the name of a location that will return data
3. Weather - write server code that will handle a request for the typical weather conditions to be expected
*the json files with the objects that are returned as results to the server requests were provided in the starter code*

## Architecture
This uses node.js from a basic npm init that utilizes dotenv, cors, and express.
It is deployed on heroku but also has a standard GitHub repository.  

02-15-2021 2:00 - Application has basic scaffolding and is about to be deployed to heroku.

## Credits and Collaborations
Special thanks to Yvette Clapp and Ben Hemann for being present and working through the steps as we all try to get through this project in Remo.
